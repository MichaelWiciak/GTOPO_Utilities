Module Plan:

1. Read File Module as gtopoRead
Read gtopo file, assigns them to the heap (and gtopoImage structure) and outputs the memory address of the gtopo file to the module that requested it.
Checks for errors and outputs the error code and requests the error string from error Handling.

2. Write File Module
Write and creates the gtopo files based on parameters.
Checks for errors and outputs the error code and requests the error string from error Handling.

3. Error handing Module
Centralises all the error codes and error handling. Takes the name of the function and the error code and calls the appropriate output string.

4. gtopoEcho
Takes in a gtopo file and outputs that same file under a specified output file name
Checks for errors and calls error handling module to prints error strings.

5. gtopoComp
Takes two gtopo file names as arguments, reads them in and tests whether they are logically identical. Calls error handling module if error occurs. Reads the images supplied using read module.

6. gtopoPrintLand
Converts the .dem gtopo file into a file specified by the user, while the values in the .dem will be converted to an understandable format for the user. The user specifies what
values specify what symbols.

7. gtopoAssembleReduce
Performs assemble on a specified file and reduces it by a given factor, without saving it to disk between operations.

8. gtopoReduce
Takes 3 arguments:
	1.an input file (binary)
	2. an integer factor n, and
	3. an output file
and reduces the input file by that factor in each dimension. Calls error handling module if error occurs. Reads the files using read module and writes the output using write module.

9. Check correct values Module
Check if correct parameter length is supplied and if they are of the right type. If not, returns an error code. The module that called it will decide what to do with this information. Contains checks for various other modules.

10. gtopoAssemble
Can be used to assemble a large image from smaller ones. It should take 3n+3 arguments of which the first three are:
1. an output file name
2. width of the output image
3. height of the output image
and the remainder are the layout: triples of:
3i+1. row at which the subimage starts
3i+2. column at which the subimage starts
3i+3. The subimage to insert at that location
Calls error handling module if error occurs. Uses read module and write module for reading, writing respectively.


13. gtopoTile
Takes 3 arguments, an input file (binary), an integer factor n, and an output file name template. It should divide the input file into nxn smaller images corresponding to parts of the image.
Calls error handling module if error occurs.
